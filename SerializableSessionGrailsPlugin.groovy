    def description = '''\\
For development only, installs a new Tomcat Valve that will monitor the
HTTP session and ensure that all objects that go into it can be serialized/ deserialized
according to java.io.Serializable rules.

It does this by actually serializing/ deserializing the session on every request and throwing an exception
(which is logged) if it does not conform.

To see more information on what is going on, set the logging level of com.dawsonsystems.session to INFO or DEBUG.
